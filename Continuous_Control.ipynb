    "At the end of this notebook, when you execute `env.close()`, it does not clean up the environment completely. Instead, the Unity environment process becomes a \"zombie\" process. A zombie process is one that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table because its parent process hasn’t properly reaped it.\n",
    "You can yourself verify this by running these commands in the terminal. Find the parent process ID (PPID) of the zombie process:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ps -o pid,ppid,stat,cmd | grep Reacher\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the parent process (PPID) is not 1, kill it to clean up the zombie process:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "kill -9 <PPID>\n",
